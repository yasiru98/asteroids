# Asteroids
A remake of Artari Asteroids made in Unity using C#
The game's main focus is the ship, contolled by the player. 
The player must shoot and survive hordes of asteroids that subdivide to make a larger menacing force! 
Your enemiesâ€™ main goal is to kill you by running into you and breaking down your defenses in the process.  
Shoot projectiles at the enemies to break them down into smaller enemies; shoot again to destroy them forever.
